# Discrete-Molecular-Dynamics-Data-Analysis-Utilities
## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains utility programs for the analysis of simulation data generated by Discrete Molecular Dynamics (DMD, available at [Molecules in Action](https://www.moleculesinaction.com/pdmd.html)).
DMD is a molecular dynamics algorithms with significantly improved computational efficiency and proven accuracy in wide applications. 
The utility programs in this repository are designed to analyze large simulation datasets generated in DMD simulations. 

## Dependencies
Python 3.7 or later is recommended.
