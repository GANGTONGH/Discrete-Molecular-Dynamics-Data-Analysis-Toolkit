# Discrete-Molecular-Dynamics-Data-Analysis-Utilities
This GitHub repository contains utility programs for the analysis of simulation data generated by Discrete Molecular Dynamics (available at [Molecules in Action](https://www.moleculesinaction.com/pdmd.html)).
Discrete Molecular Dynamics (DMD) is a unique molecular dynamics algorithm with significantly improved computational efficiency. Briefly, DMD utilizes discrete step potential functions and collision-driven dynamics to achieve rapid and comprehensive sampling of the conformational space of biomolecules.
