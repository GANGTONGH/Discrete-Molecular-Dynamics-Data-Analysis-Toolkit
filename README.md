# Discrete-Molecular-Dynamics-Data-Analysis-Utilities
## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains utility programs for the analysis of simulation data generated by Discrete Molecular Dynamics (DMD, available at [Molecules in Action](https://www.moleculesinaction.com/pdmd.html)).
DMD is a molecular dynamics algorithms with significantly improved computational efficiency and proven accuracy in wide applications. 
The utility programs in this repository are designed to analyze large simulation datasets generated in DMD simulations. 

## Dependencies
* Python, version 3.7 or later is recommended. The needed libraries:
** Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org)
** Numpy (https://numpy.org)
* Awk (https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk)

## Secondary Structure

## Fibrillar Aggregate Morphology Analysis
This program is used for deciding the type of fibrillar aggregate formed by protein or peptide chains. 
Briefly, the type of protein fibrillar aggregate can be defined using its number of layers and Î²-sheet sizes.
